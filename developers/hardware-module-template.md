# Hardware module template
Most modules have a laser-cut plastic frame that snaps together. Module frames
have a number of features, such as threaded holes, to make them compatible with
the [grid system][grid]. To aid in the development of new modules,
we have prepared a template containing all the correct geometry for an empty
"box" module. The module template contains ```.3dm``` (Rhino), ```.ai```
(Illustrator), and ```.dxf``` file formats, and can be found [here][template].
Feel free to to modify the file to your liking and don't forget to
[share][contribute] if you think you've created something that could be useful
to others.

# The Opsoro grid
The Opsoro construction system is based around a grid system. Grid plates form
the backbone onto which the modules are attached. Modules can be attached to a
grid plate using a single M3x10 cap screw. The video below shows a quick
demonstration of this principle.

## Dimensions
The figure above shows the basic grid dimensions. The grid consists of
3mm &times; 3mm square holes, spaced at an 8mm interval. The design files for a
standard A4-sized grid can be found
[here](https://github.com/OPSORO/BUILD/tree/master/grid). The A4 grid can be
used as a starting point, however nothing is stopping you from creating
custom-sized grids.

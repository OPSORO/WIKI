# Hardware
This chapter describes all the hardware components of the Opsoro platform.
This includes general background information, technical details of the
electronics, module assembly guides, as well as instructions to build complete
social robots.

The source files for all the hardware components can be found on GitHub inside
the [OPSORO/BUILD](https://github.com/opsoro/build) repository. The OPSORO
hardware components are manufactured using laser-cutting and 3D-printing,
manufacturing techniques that are commonly found in fablabs and universities.
The designs are primarily created using [Rhinoceros](http://www.rhino3d.com),
though the repository also contains the appropriate derivative files
(e.g. STL, DXF).

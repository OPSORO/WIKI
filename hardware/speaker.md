{% block steps %}
### Step 1
Strip the insulation from both ends of the wire. Split the two conductors over a
distance of 1cm on both ends.

### Step 2
Using a dupont crimp tool, attach two crimp connectors to one end of the cable.

### Step 3
Insert the crimp connectors into the crimp housing. Mind the orientation of the
little barb on the crimp connector. Push until you hear it click into position.

### Step 4
Tin the ends of cable, then solder them to the tabs of the miniature speaker.
The polarity of the wires does not matter.

### Step 5
Attach the miniature speaker to the front plate of the speaker module using 4
M3x6 cap screws. The screws attach from the back so that the screw heads are
hidden inside once the module is finished.

### Step 6
Blah blah

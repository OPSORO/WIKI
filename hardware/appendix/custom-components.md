## Laser-cut components
Laser-cutting is used extensively in the hardware design of Opsoro. Most parts
are cut from 3 mm ABS plastic. Most parts can be connected using the
snap connectors, meaning no extra fasteners are required.

## 3D-printed components
Some parts of the Opsoro system are 3D printed using a hobby-grade 3D printer.
We print our parts on Ultimaker 2 machines, but the parts are designed so that
they could be printed on most low-end FDM machines. The 3D printed parts usually
have some small artifacts, such as stringing and blobs. These can be removed
using flush cutters. Holes in 3D printed parts usually require some cleanup as
well. Go through the holes with a small drill to clear any debris. Most holes
are 3 mm in size, and can be cleaned up using a 3 mm drill.

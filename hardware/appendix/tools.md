# List of tools
The purpose of this article is to give a visual overview of all tools needed to
build Opsoro robots. The various assembly guides reference this document in
order to give extra information on the various tools.

## Hex key

A hex key, also known as an allen wrench, is used to tighten or loosen hex
socket fasteners. Hex keys have the advantage that they are a bit easier to use
in tight spaces than a conventional screwdriver. A 2.5mm hex key is required for
using the Opsoro system.

## Servo tester {#servo-tester}

A servo tester is a small device that can be used to quickly test the
functionality of hobby servos. They are used for centering a servo and for
checking whether a servo is still working. Servo testers have three different
modes: manual, neutral, and sweep. Most servo testers do not come with a power
supply. In order to use a servo tester, you will need to attach a stable 5V
power source. One option is to use a lab power supply. Another option is to a
Dupont connector to an existing 5V adapter, such as an USB charger.

## Wire stripper {#stripper}

Wire strippers are used to remove the insulation from the end of wires so that
they may be soldered or crimped to.
We like using high-quality automatic wire strippers, though less expensive tools
are certainly serviceable as well! However, if you need to strip a lot of wires,
it might be advisable to invest in a good wire stripping tool.

## DuPont crimping tool {#dupont}

A crimping tool is a specialized hand tool that is used to attach metal contacts
to the end of a wire in order to attach a connector. A crimping tool is specific
to the type of connector used. We use DuPont connectors for most wiring. This
connector is compatible with 2.54mm pin headers and the crimping tool is cheap
and versatile. A DuPont crimping tool can be bought from various vendors
(e.g. [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1213)).
[This instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Dupont-Crimp-Tool-Tutorial/)
gives a good explanation of how to use a crimping tool to create custom cables.
Using a crimping tool takes a bit of practice to get right, so don't be
discouraged if you don't get the hang of it right away.

## Soldering iron {#soldering-iron}

A soldering iron is used to make permanent electrical connections using solder.
It is a versatile tool for any sort of electronics work. A simple pencil-style
iron can be bought for less than 20â‚¬. A temperature-controlled soldering station
is a bit more expensive, but offers better control and will make a difficult
soldering job much easier.

# Hardware Requirements

The following hardware is needed to use OpsoroOS:
* A Raspberry Pi
* An >8GB SD card
* An [OpsoroHAT][hat] (optional, but highly recommended)

OpsoroOS has been tested with the following single-board computers:
* Raspberry Pi 1 model B+
* Raspberry Pi 2 model B
* Raspberry Pi 3 model B

An [OpsoroHAT][hat] is required to make the software do
anything useful, though the software will run without it. OpsoroOS can be used
through a web interface over a WiFi network created by the Raspberry Pi. For
this, the Raspberry Pi needs to have WiFi connectivity. The Raspberry PI 3 has
built-in WiFi. For other boards, an external WiFi dongle must be used. We
recommend the [WiPi][wipi] dongle, though any dongle that supports AP-mode can
be used.

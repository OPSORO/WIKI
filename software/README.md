# Introduction
This chapter describes the web-based software of the Opsoro platform.
This includes installation, troubleshooting, configuration and usage. OpsoroOS
is built around an app-based interface inspired by tablets and smartphones. Each
app is built around one specific task and has a dedicated interface. We have
already created several built-in apps that are ready to use. However, the system
 is intended to be extended so we invite the community to contribute great apps!

The source code of the Opsoro software can be found on GitHub inside
the [OPSORO/OS][repo] repository. The back-end of Opsoro software is written in
Python using the wonderful [Flask][flask] web framework. The front-end of the
software is built upon the [Foundation][fdn] framework. Interactive components
are created using [jQuery][jq] and [Knockout.js][ko].

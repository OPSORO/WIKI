# Introduction
This chapter describes the web-based software of the Opsoro platform.
This includes installation, troubleshooting, configuration and usage. OpsoroOS
is built around an app-based interface inspired by tablets and smartphones. Each
app is built around one specific task and has a dedicated interface. We have
already created several built-in apps that are ready to use. However, the system
is intended to be extended so we invite the community to contribute great apps!
Instructions on how to program your own apps can be found
[here](/developers/api-documentation).
